        	<p class="question">How do you grade / What do we do for the midterm?</p>
        	<p class="answer">I grade based on whether you made a serious attempt at your website. That being said, I am not looking for a visually-impressive site that looks like it took weeks to plan out. Rather, I'm looking at your progress log and seeing what types of efforts you've made to improve your website, even if you've failed at doing so. For the midterm, I'll be checking your midway site progress and seeing if you made a reasonable effort (even if you failed) at your site, and providing feedback as to what more you can do.</p>

            <p class="question">Can we add things like videos to our website?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes! There's a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp"> < video > </a> tag you can use, although I don't have much experience with it myself.</p>

            <p class="question">What is the root stuff with variables and why they matter? What about :before?</p>
            <p class="answer">:root allows you to select and apply properties to the root element of the document. This means that any variable declarations you make to the root can be accessed by any (all) children in the DOM, essentially making any variables you declare global. Variables in css are important just as they would be in any other language: they provide you with a reference to a value such that if you change that value, every property that references that value also changes too. This can be very useful for example with colors when you want to change all of a certain color on a webpage (change all greens to blues).<br> :before is a css selector that allows you to place text before a < p > tag, but is usually just used to change the text/content of a text-based tag.</p>
