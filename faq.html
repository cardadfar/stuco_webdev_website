        <div class='qa'>
        	<p class="question">Are there late days for assignments?</p>
        	<p class="answer">Due dates for the most part will not be inforced. It is in a student's best interest to complete the weekly assignments in a timely manner so that the work doesn't pile up. The Midterm & Final will have a more strict deadline.</p>
